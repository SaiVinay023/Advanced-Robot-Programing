I have attached the log file for your reference which I got.

Log file
holds a series of text lines in couples:
<timestamp> <from G | from S > <value>
<timestamp> <sent value> (a sample of the wave)
The log file contents is output anytime G receives a suitable request from the console.

So we got the data saved in the log file as discusse.

I have connected the pipes from S to P, P to L, G to P.
And we stored the values and timestamps of G and S.

And the computation of P for new token is also succesful.

And with the results we got, we can draw an sinewave.

I have attached the log file with values I got.
