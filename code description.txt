Code description//

Here I couldve done code for the pipes connection in the time I got. I couldn't add socket connection. Sorry, I couldn't add the socket to the code.

1)Here in this code in first we declared the libraries which are used in the code.
2)we have taken void signal handlers for intializing and stopping S process.later we call these in the main function.
3)we have declared the void function for partial delay of 1000ms in the starting.
4)And then main function starts, here we declared the pipes which are connected initially
5)And we have given a function for opening and reading configuration file, it reads the RF value from the configuration file.
6)And then S receives possix signals from console, and that is saved in the logfile.txt, as we have to take S values.
7)For our usage we printed the logfile values on console, with that the S code ends.
8)we will come to L code,in L process we just open logfile, read&write permission, error handling, L function is used to save the values to log file. And then the L code ends.
9)for G process we give the pipe connection and its a child process of P.
10)Then wwe come to the part of computing the value of token in P, the received token is calculated and the modified new token is delivered.
11)we will attach that values to the log file, and we can see that token values are printed in logfile.
